# Working Through "Scala for the Impatient"

This repository contains my solutions and notes while working through "Scala for the Impatient" by Cay Horstmann. 
The goal is to develop familiarity with the language without using ChatGPT or other AI LLMs.

## Scala Levels
The `[AL][1-3]` refer to Martin Odersky's Scala levels.

## Progress

### The Basics (A1)
- [x] The Basics
- [x] Control Structures and Functions  
- [x] Arrays  
- [x] Maps and Tuples  
- [x] Classes  
- [x] Objects  
- [ ] Packages and Imports  
- [ ] Inheritance  
- [ ] Files and Regular Expressions  

### Advanced Topics (L1)
- [ ] Traits  
- [ ] Operators  
- [ ] Higher-Order Functions  

### Collections (A2)
- [ ] Collections

To limit this project's scope, I plan to skip the advanced library builder modules of chapters 17-20.
